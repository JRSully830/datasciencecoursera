The class project involved accessing, integrating, transforming and summazing data related some wearable technology research done by samsung.

Objective was to demonstrate basic competence in working with the data and meeting stated project objectives. The primary output was a text file with average metrics results for variables manipultated in the samsung experiments. 
Results were grouped by volunteer subject and type of activity.

Project Deliverables:
======================================
- ReadMe.md -- file outlining elements included in the Class Project outputs
- meanGroupByJRS.txt  -- summarized project tidy output after data was cleaned and summarized
- Run_Analysis.R  -- R code file to load experiment data and perform cleansing and summarization 
- CodeBook.txt - Text file listing the variables included in the analysis output 

Notes: 
======
- Since there were some variable names that were duplicated in the experiment data, the variable number was appended to the variable name to make each name unique.
